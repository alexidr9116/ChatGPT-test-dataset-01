Shortly after the School Newspaper published the article, "Showering Together: A Closer Look at Tarpon Springs Middle School's Controversial Policy" the School Newspaper students mailed Carl Anderson, retired PE Teacher at Tarpon Springs Middle School, a few paper copies of this edition of the school paper, as a thanks for him taking the time to interview with the school newspaper. Carl Anderson and his wife both read it, and his wife complimented Carl on his ongoing civic engagement even after he was retired. That coming week was Thanksgiving break, Rakesh had to fly to Tokyo, Japan for a 1 week business trip on very, very important and intense SpaceX business, so Tracy and their son Brian Patel decided to spend Thanksgiving weekend at the home of Tracy's Dad and Brian's Grandpa, Carl Anderson.  Brian was always especially close to his grandpa, Carl Anderson.  For as long as 10 year old Brian could remember, his Grandpa and he would do a little roughhousing, wrestling and play fighting whenever Brian and his parents visited his Grandparent's house.  His parents were both happy that Brian and his Grandpa got along so well.
Tracy and Rakesh Patel, an interracial couple, are successful in their careers; Tracy is a lawyer and Rakesh works at SpaceX. They have a son named Brian who is successful in school and well-liked by his peers. Tracy left her high-paying job to work as a part-time attorney for the local public school system while also raising her son. Carl Anderson, Tracy's father and a retired PE teacher, was interviewed by a school newspaper club about his support for the school's shower policy. During Thanksgiving break, Tracy and her son Brian spend the holiday at Carl's house.  Brian has always been close with his Grandpa (Carl Anderson) and Grandma (Carl Anderson's wife).
