"I don't want to take up too much of your time, but I am also very curious about SpaceX and what kind of stuff your doing in Japan right now.  I heard from my friends at sports camp this week that you're in Japan right now working closely with Elon Musk this weekend.  It's kind of like you are famous and my friends know more about you than I do!" Brian said laughing.  Brian then asked his Dad "Could you tell me any details on what you're doing in Tokyo and how things are going for you and SpaceX?"
