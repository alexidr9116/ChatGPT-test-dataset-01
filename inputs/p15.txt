Brian smiled back warmly at his Mom, feeling a sense of warmth and comfort spread through him. He knew that whatever challenges lay ahead, he could handle them with his family by his side.  Finally Brian said: "Mom thanks for talking to me.  I feel a tiny, little better.  Still I work hard to be athletic and cool, even though I'm such a short, scrawny kid.  As you know, I'm so short and immature I look like a 2nd grader.  How will I maintain my status as the "cool kid" in 6th grade?  I am still very worried about maintaining my status as the "cool kid" in 6th grade while now facing the idea of being undressed and "on public display" in front of all my classmates.  And will there just be my 6th grade classmates in the shower with me?  Or will I also be "on public display" in front of all the 7th grade and 8th grade boys as well? Plus Mom, I know you love me, but aren't I a little too old to be talking to my Mom about this kind of stuff???  I feel this a more kind of a man-to-man talk."  Brian asked his Mom while visibly blushing.  Brian was embarrassed to have blushed in front of his Mom, and thought perhaps he had shared too many details with her.
