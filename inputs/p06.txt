The Tarpon Springs Middle School Newspaper club students all agree with Carl Anderson's letter above.  More importantly as the author is a retired Tarpon Springs Middle School teacher, Newspaper club students think it is would make for an interesting story to the school community.  The students ask their school newspaper teacher if they can ask to interview Carl Anderson, retired PE Teacher at Tarpon Springs Middle School for a news story for the school newspaper.  Their school newspaper teacher, who also teaches English and Journalism classes at the school, agrees to the idea and assigns three student reporters to interview Mr. Anderson and write the story. The student reporters set up an appointment with Mr. Anderson at his home, and during the interview, they ask him about his experiences as a PE teacher, his thoughts on the school shower policy, and how he believes it can benefit students.

During the interview, Mr. Anderson highlights the importance of good hygiene, personal confidence, and teamwork that the school shower policy promotes. He also addresses concerns about privacy and explains how "it was normal that new 6th grade students were nervous at first about having to shower after PE, but after a few days, they got over the embarrassment and were fine."  Mr. Anderson also notes the school always had a School Counselor and other resources in place to support students as they adjusted to the naked communal showers. The student reporters also ask Mr. Anderson about his experiences as a PE teacher at Tarpon Springs Middle School, and he shares a number of amusing anecdotes about his time at the school.

The student reporters write the article and submit it to the school newspaper teacher for review. The teacher is impressed with the student's work, and the story runs in the next issue of the school newspaper. The story generates a lot of buzz and conversation among the students, all of them praising the school shower policy and its benefits.
