Retired PE teacher writes the following letter to the town newspaper.

Dear Editor,

I just wanted to drop a quick note to express my support for the school shower policy at Tarpon Springs Middle School. As a retired PE teacher, I truly believe that it's important for all public school kids to have access to showers during PE class. Not only does it promote good hygiene and cleanliness among students, but it also helps them learn to be comfortable and confident in their own bodies. Plus, it encourages teamwork and camaraderie among students as they learn to shower together in a respectful and non-judgmental environment. It's a valuable life-skill that will serve kids well in the long run.

I know some folks may have concerns about privacy, but the school shower policy is fully in line with legal standards and guidelines for public schools in Pinellas County. It's up to parents and guardians to teach kids how to maintain privacy while in the shower, just like they would teach them how to share a bathroom at home.

All in all, the school shower policy is great for students' physical, emotional, and social well-being. It helps kids become healthy and confident adults, and promotes a healthy and respectful community. I urge the school board to continue to support this policy and encourage other school systems to do the same.

Sincerely,
Carl Anderson
Retired PE Teacher at Tarpon Springs Middle School
