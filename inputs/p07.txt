Tarpon Springs Middle School has a policy that requires all students to shower together during PE class. There are no privacy measures of any kind in the showers.  Also, school policy requires all showers to be taken without bathing suit or other clothing. This policy has been met with mixed reactions from students and parents alike, with most praising its benefits for promoting good hygiene and teamwork, while a few have concerns about modesty and personal comfort.

When asked about the benefits of the policy, Mr. Anderson highlighted the importance of good hygiene, personal confidence, and teamwork.

Mr. Anderson also emphasized the importance of teamwork, saying that "showering together encourages camaraderie among students and helps them learn to be respectful and non-judgmental of one another." He believes this is a valuable life skill that will serve students well in their future lives, as it will help them feel comfortable and confident in a wide range of situations such as showers at home, dorms, sports teams, and even at work.

When asked about concerns about privacy, Mr. Anderson acknowledged that this is a valid concern, but he emphasized that the school's policy is fully in line with legal standards and guidelines for public schools in Pinellas County. "It's up to parents and guardians to teach kids how to maintain privacy while in the shower, just like they would teach them how to share a bathroom at home," he said.

Overall, Mr. Anderson believes that the school shower policy is beneficial for students' physical, emotional, and social well-being. He urged the school board to continue to support this policy and encouraged other school systems to adopt similar policies.

In conclusion, the school shower policy at Tarpon Springs Middle School is a well thought out policy that promotes good hygiene, personal confidence, and teamwork among students.
