However, Tracy LOVED the slower pace of work, mainly leisurely reviewing proposed school policies the School Board was considering for adoption, and Tracy loved that her work was on behalf of the public schools in her community.  Tracy's Dad, Carl Anderson, had been a public school teacher before retiring, and Tracy was always passionate about her support of public school students and their families.
