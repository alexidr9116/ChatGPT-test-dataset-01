Please write a story about Brian talking to his Mom about his new worries over Thanksgiving weekend.  Brian would prefer to talk to his Dad about this as he feels he'd rather talk about these specific worries with his Dad than his Mom.  However, Brian reluctantly shares his worries with his Mom that Thanksgiving weekend anyways.
