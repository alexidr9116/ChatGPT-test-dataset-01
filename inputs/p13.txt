Please write a summary of the following:
Nevertheless while Brian was neither shy nor modest, Brian was already thinking about his transition to middle and how to remain the "the cool kid" in 6th grade.  Brian had always worked hard on athletics and excelled in sports.  Brian was a half-Indian, half-white short kid.  In fact Brian was so short that as a practical joke in 5th grade recess, Brian once intentionally blended into the 2nd grade line in recess and Brian was so short that the 2nd grade teacher NEVER even noticed.  Brian's fellow classmates thought Brian's joke was riotously funny.  But Brian embraced his shortness. Brian was the fastest runner in the 5th grade, and had "the best, most awesome moves" in sports, and Brian work kept improving his athletic skills.  He'd frequently win the game for his team due to this and Brian's classmates greatly admired him.  Brian was also honest, friendly, kind and really, really smart.  Brian was one of the most popular kids in the 5th grade.  Still Brian was worried how he could stay the "cool kid", especially after starting 6th grade PE and having to shower together with his classmates.  While not modest, Brian was stilled worried, as he was such a short, scrawny kid and Brian had never been undressed and "on public display" in front of all his friends before.  Brian wanted to remain the "successful, cool kid" in the sixth grade.
