After a big Thanksgiving dinner, Tracy and her son Brian Patel spent the night in spared bedrooms in their grandparent's house.  As Brian settled into bed in one of the spare bedrooms, Brian noticed the middle school newspaper on the bed stand.  Since Brian knew he would be attending that middle school next school year as a rising 6th grader, he decides to skim the newspaper.  One article then catches Brian's eye "Showering Together: A Closer Look at Tarpon Springs Middle School's Controversial Policy".  Brian had never known that his new middle school had a shower policy, and decides to read the article.  Brian was surprised that the school would require all students to take communal showers together.  However, Brian's Dad, Sam Patel, had been Brian taking to the town's Swimming Pool and Recreation Center which had communal showers when he was 4 years old, and Brian and his Dad had been regular visitors there since then.  Growing up, Brian always took communal showers at the town's Swimming Pool and Recreation Center  and never had any problems or concerns.
The article describes that a retired PE teacher, Carl Anderson, at Tarpon Springs Middle School, supports the school's policy requiring all students to shower together during PE class with no privacy measures. The policy is to promote good hygiene, personal confidence and teamwork. The article also mentions that the policy is in line with legal standards and guidelines for public schools in Pinellas County. Brian, a rising 6th grader at Tarpon Springs Middle School, reads the article while spending Thanksgiving at his grandparent's home. He is surprised to learn about the policy but has no concerns as he is already accustomed to communal showers from frequent visits to the town's swimming pool and recreation center with his father.
