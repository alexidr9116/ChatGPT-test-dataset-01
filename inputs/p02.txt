HEADLINE: Parents hope to send school shower rule down the drain

Pinellas County School officials think cleanliness should come before modesty.

When school starts Monday, teachers are supposed to insist that all middle and high school students take showers after physical education classes and athletic and intramural activities.

Not showering will be considered a discipline violation, and repeated refusal can lead to suspension. 

Meryl Geller and her husband, Richard, planned to protest the policy to the School Board today. They see it as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.

"They (the schools) put it in the same category as disrupting class or disfiguring the school," Mrs. Geller said Tuesday. "I think this whole thing is preposterous."

Her son will be a sixth-grader at Tarpon Springs Middle.

"I can't imagine that any adult would cheerfully volunteer to take a gang shower," she said. "I don't think children would, either. If anything, they have a more profound sense of modesty than adults."

The showering rule isn't new, but some schools have not been enforcing it stringently.

Top administrators have told the schools to do so.

In a letter to parents, the four area superintendents said that personal hygiene has not been emphasized enough, and that few students were showering after physical education.

Some returned to class with offensive odors.

"You get three or four in a room all day, and the odor was just unbearable," said Area IV Superintendent Eric Whitted. "We wanted the kids going back clean and smelling reasonably well."

Whitted said officials also were concerned that not showering could leave the students susceptible to health problems, such as staph infections. Mrs. Geller said she is a physician, and "I've never seen anybody in an emergency room or in my office with a health complication from not taking a shower after physical education."

She isn't arguing against cleanliness, only against public exposure, Mrs. Geller said. "I think nothing compares to the offense of having to disrobe publicly."

Pasco, Hillsborough and Hernando counties don't require students to use the provided showers.

"I think Pinellas County is very courageous in taking a stand on back to health, back to showers, back to good grooming," said Worth Littell, supervisor of secondary physical education in Hillsborough.

Also mentioned in the School Board meeting was that the school system had commissioned an outside, independent consulting firm to conduct a review of the school system's Physical Education program, including its school shower policy.  The consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, completed its year long review and submitted exhaustive report on the matter earlier this summer. Some of the findings in the report were that in professional opinion of a licensed child psychologists who had completed a full, thorough review of Pinellas County's school shower policy, "a student experiencing discomfort with the shower policy is likely related to a lack of exposure and familiarity to communal showers. By requiring this student to still to follow the school shower policy, the student will be given the opportunity to become more familiar with communal showers and to learn to cope with it over time".  The child psychologist also noted that "shower shy" students in particular benefited from the school shower policy could as an important step in helping to improve their emotional and psychological well-being.  The students' age and developmental stage suggest that they are capable of coping with and navigating uncomfortable situations. The child psychologist report concluded that the Pinellas County School shower policy helps all students to develop important life skills that will serve them well in the future.

Physical education teachers said enforcing the rule may be difficult because showers are hard to patrol.

"I'm sure there are going to be a lot of students who rebel against the policy," said Karen Horning, head of physical education at Gibbs High.

"It's going to be a problem for a lot of kids," she said. "Some are more modest than others, and kids can be mean sometimes."

"Just changing clothes is traumatic for some of them," said Dorothy Thomas, physical education teacher at Dunedin Highland Middle School.

Art Jones, physical education teacher at Bay Point Middle, called the policy "a pain in the butt. They pay me to be a teacher. They don't pay me to be a shower monitor."

If a student doesn't want to take a shower, "I certainly don't get paid enough to wrestle him in there," Jones said.
