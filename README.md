# ChatGPT-test-dataset-01
a small test dataset for use with OpenAI's ChatGPT

test-dataset-01 was tested using the following three approaches:

1. revChatGPT
https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT
Reverse Engineered ChatGPT API by OpenAI. Extensible for chatbots etc.
The "revChatGPT" GitHub repository is a reverse-engineered version of the OpenAI ChatGPT API that is extensible for chatbots. The repository includes instructions for installing and configuring the package, as well as examples of how to use it to send an HTTP POST request and create a chatbot object. This repo is written in 100% python.

2. ChatGPT API Server
https://github.com/ChatGPT-Hackers/ChatGPT-API-server
The "ChatGPT API Server" GitHub repository is a server that allows to interact with ChatGPT models. This package can be installed by golang installing the package or by building it from the source. Once it is installed it can be run by providing a port number and an API key. The package also includes a Firefox agent and a Python-based client. The package provides various endpoints for making ChatGPT requests, adding and deleting users and tokens, and getting all the connections. The package also includes an admin key that can be used for authentication. This repo is written in 100% golang.

3. Manually copying and pasting the 21 prompts ("p01.txt"..."p21.txt") into Chat GPT's browser interface.  Given that this dataset is rather small, the manual "copy and paste" approach may actually be the easiest of the three approaches.

Brief summary of the story told by test-dataset-01:

* Rakesh Patel and Tracy Anderson are a happily married couple with one son, 5th grader Brian Patel. Rakesh has an extremely successful career at SpaceX, which occasionally requires him to travel internationally for work. Tracy previously worked as a top lawyer at a prestigious law firm but chose to leave her position to take on a much slower-paced part-time role as a school board attorney. Tracy wanted to be able to spend more time with and take care of their son Brian. Both Tracy and Rakesh are supportive of their son's concerns regarding the showering in the PE class at Brian's upcoming middle school. Rakesh recently traveled to Tokyo, Japan for an important SpaceX business trip. Brian is curious about his Dad's work at SpaceX, and during a video call from his Dad, he asked about the details of Rakesh's trip and the work he's been doing there. Rakesh shared with Brian about the meetings and projects he's been working on, and how it's all part of SpaceX's mission to make space travel more accessible and sustainable. Brian was fascinated and impressed by his Dad's work, and felt proud to be the son of someone who is making such a big impact in the world.
